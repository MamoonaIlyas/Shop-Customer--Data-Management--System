-> RUNNING OF THE PROGRAM:
This output showcases a shop management system in its early stages. Users can log in and choose to manage shop or customer data. The shop menu allows adding, updating, searching, and deleting product information like ID, name, price, and quantity. It even has an intriguing "Enter shopkeeper records" option, possibly for managing staff in the future. The customer menu offers similar functionalities for customer purchase records, including searching by ID or name. While some features seem incomplete and prompts repetitive. 
->USE OF FILES: The file used in the program is the fstream file. It allows to read and write data. The opening mode of the file is (ios::app) append. The use of this opening mode appends the entered data in the text file created in the computerÂ memory.
